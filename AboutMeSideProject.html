      <h2><u>Life at RifleGear:</u><br /> <i>The Range Side</i></h2>
      <p>
        For the past 4 and a half years, I have worked at a gun store in North Texas called <i>RifleGear</i>. 
        Over these past 4 years, I have learned and grown a lot as a young adult. This job is what I believe 
        to be my first <b>stepping stone</b> into a more serious & professional role in my <b><u>career path</u></b>. 
        I have learned how to <u>remain calm</u> in high stress enviorments and how to <u>quickly think</u> on my feet; when faced 
        with potentially dangerous, life changing circumstances out on the range. There have even been times where 
        I've even had live firearms pointed at me!! (Not <i>malciously</i>, but due to a "new shooter"s ignorance
         on <b>gun safety</b>.)</p>
      <p>
        Going through these expereciences has certainly <b><i>changed me</i> for the 
          <u>better</u></b>, and has taught me to be patient with people who are new to 
          the sport / hobby. Afterall, <u>everyone has to start somewhere</u>. Through 
          understanding that, I believe that I have been able to apply that same patience 
          into my personal life. Such as with my friends and family. Whether it be helping 
          my grandma figure out how to send an email on her iPhone, getting rid of small bugs 
          and rodents (that absolutely <b><i>terrify</i></b> my girlfriend!) in our apartment, 
          to <u>helping my friends</u> get into the hobby and sports of firearms.</p>
